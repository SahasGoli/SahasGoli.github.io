I am a Senior at Vanderbilt University where I study Computer Science and Economics. At Vanderbilt, I serve as the Head Teaching Assisstant for CS 3251â€”Intermediate Software Design. In the past, I've worked at both Robinhood and Cousera as a Software Engineering Intern. After graduation, I plan on going to New York to join Citadel as a Software Engineer in the Portfolio Construction Group.
